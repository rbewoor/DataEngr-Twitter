Questions for the data engineering project:
1) Show the top 10 handles by NUMBER OF TWEETS BY USER AS MAINTAINED IN TWITTER RECORDS - NOT BASED ON ACTUAL NUMBER OF TWEETS DOWNLOADED VIA API (what shows on the top of the users profile)
db.TwitterCol1.find( {}, {"_id" :0, "user.screen_name" :1, "user.statuses_count" :1} ).sort({"user.statuses_count": -1}).limit(10)

2) Show the top 10 tweets by the number of LIKES FOR TWEETS
db.TwitterCol1.find( {}, {"_id" :0, "user.screen_name" :1, "favorite_count" :1} ).sort({"favorite_count": -1}).limit(10)
favorite_count


3) Show the top 10 handles by the number of LIKES FOR USER
db.TwitterCol1.find( {}, {"_id" :0, "user.screen_name" :1, "user.favourites_count" :1} ).sort({"user.favourites_count": -1}).limit(10)
user.favourites_count

4) Show Total COUNT OF RETWEETS in the pulled data
db.TwitterCol1.find({"text": {$regex: /^RT /}}).count()
to see the sample of what is being checked
db.TwitterCol1.find({"text": {$regex: /^RT /}}, {"_id" :0, "user.screen_name" :1, "text" :1}).limit(10)


5) Show the top 10 user handles by number of times they have tweeted - BASED ON THE DATA PULLED BY OUR PROGRAM (NOT LIKE IN QUERY 1)

Show top 10 users by number of times they tweeted OUT OF THE SET OF TWEETS CAPTURED BY OUR SYSTEM

tabbed for readability
db.TwitterCol1.aggregate([
	{$group: {"_id": "$user.screen_name", "NoOfTweets": {$sum :1} }} ,
	{$sort: {"NoOfTweets": -1}} ,
	{$limit: 10}
])

5a)  additional queries to verify the info shown in main query 5
			sub queries for information: show Count how many unique User handles are in the pulled data
			db.TwitterCol1.distinct("user.id_str").length		shows the count of distinct user ids
			db.TwitterCol1.distinct("user.id_str")				shows the actual list of the individual user ids
				

6) Think of any additional interesting questions.............

Query to find if there are any records that are screwed up and don't have any data:
db.TwitterCol1.find({"created_at": null}).count()
